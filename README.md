# Project-5---Heart-Disease-Detection
Cardiovascular disease remains a leading cause of death globally, prompting the need for effective risk‐prediction models. This project implements a reproducible machine learning pipeline to predict heart disease using a curated patient dataset. Data preprocessing includes one‑hot encoding of categorical variables and stratified splitting into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing sets. Three classifiers—logistic regression, decision tree, and k‑nearest neighbors—are trained and evaluated. Performance metrics (accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix) reveal that logistic regression achieves the most balanced results. This workflow lays the groundwork for further improvements, such as hyperparameter optimization and ensemble methods.
